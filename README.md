# Court-IQ Server

This is the backend service for the Court-IQ platform â€” a basketball analytics and sports betting application. The server handles player image hosting, stores a rich archive of historical NBA data (50+ years), and includes user management infrastructure built to support future personalization features. While the historical data is not yet surfaced in the frontend, it is fully structured and ready for integration.

Additionally, this backend communicates with a connected Flask microservice that powers the search functionality (currently under development) and is designed to scale with added features.
